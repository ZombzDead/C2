# CobaltStrike

Cobalt Strike is a platform for adversary simulations and red team operations. The product is designed to execute targeted attacks and emulate the post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors. This section describes the attack process supported by Cobalt Strikeâ€™s feature set. The rest of this manual discusses these features in detail.

### Usage

Activate Teamserver

    $ cd opt/tools/cobaltstrike 
    $ sudo ./teamserver <Host_IP> <password>
Leave Terminal Open 

Open new Terminal to start Cobaltstrike 

    $ sudo ./cobaltstrike
    $ cd /opt/tools/cobaltstrike
Server Connection window will pop up: Input Host, Port, username, and teamserver password 
Select "Connect" 

### Create a Listener

You will be required to create a listener for your compromised machines to connect to.

      Select Cobalt Strike > Listeners (on top left corner of GUI)
      At the bottom of the page Select "Add" (to create a Listener)
      Once all information has been put in, Select "Save"
In the Input Window, input a domain name that points to your team server. 

### Delivering Payload
    - On the top bar, Select "Attacks" > Web Drive-by > Scripted Web Delivery (This will provide us a Powershell one-liner to run on the victim host)
    - Payload will be generated, Copy/Paste the URL into Notepad, then select "OK" to close the window.
    - Copy/Paste Payload onto the Victim's host into Powershell. 
    - On the Linux system, in Cobalt Strike, go to the "Events Log". It should show you that a beacon has been established with the Victim's host. 

### Interacting with Victim Host
    - Right click on the Victim Host, go to the username and select "Interact"
  
### Elevate Attacks
    Access > Elevate

### VNC Attack

### Pivoting
    Interact > net computers 
    List computers > (right click and select "Jump")

Use net [pid] [arch] [command] [arguments] to inject the network and host enumeration tool into the specified process. 
Use net [command] [arguments] (without [pid] and [arch] arguments) to spawn a temporary process and inject the network and host enumeration tool into it. 
An exception is the net domain command which is implemented as a BOF.net domain. 

    computers - lists hosts in a domain (groups)
    dclist - lists domain controllers. (populates the targets model)
    domain - display domain for this host
    domain_controllers - lists DCs in a domain (groups)
    domain_trusts - lists domain trusts
    group - lists groups and users in groups
    localgroup - lists local groups and users in local groups. (great during lateral movement when you have to find who is a local admin on another system).
    logons - lists users logged onto a host
    sessions - lists sessions on a host
    share - lists shares on a host
    user - lists users and user information
    time - show time for a host
    view - lists hosts in a domain (browser service). (populates the targets model)
